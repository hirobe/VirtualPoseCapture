Each part of the avatar's body is moved in the following ways
- Whole body: MediaPipe Holistic(Pose)
- Hand: MediaPipe Holistic(Hand)
- Head: MediaPipe Holistic(Face)
- Mouth: MediaPipe Holistic(Face). Only opening and closing of the mouth (up and down movement of the lips)
- Eyes: Automatically look at the camera and blink randomly
